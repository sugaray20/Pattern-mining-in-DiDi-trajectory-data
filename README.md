Trajectory period: 01/05/15- 05/05/15

Job done:
1.  Split the time series into layers with 30 seconds as the gap between each adjacent time layer.
2.  Simulate all the vehicle's location based on trajectory records. 
3.  Define and input the maximum distance within each cluster and create clusters all over Beijing on different layers.
4.  Link clusters based on consecutive timestamps and identify the same clusters on each of those layers
5.  Build a trajectory pattern type called: swarm. Reference paper: Trajectory Data Mining: An Overview.
